# Assignment 2

This is a repo of code for the second assignment for the Advanced GIS: Interactive Web Mapping and Spatial Data Visualization course at NYU Wagner, Spring 2024.

As a New Years Resolution, I challenged myself to read one (1) book a month this year. While that may not be a lot for avid readers, I have found myself having less free time and, subsequently, falling out of my reading hobby over my years of being in academia. I used to read so much when I was in high school, but I tended to do it less when my homework involved reading 100 pages of heavy academic text.

So, for this assigbment I created a book planner, where my reading book is planned out by month. Most of these books I bought in high school before I left for college. So, in a way these books are me visiting my childhood and healing my inner child.

Within the code, I divided the page into two coloums. I then created buttons for each month, IDing them by position in the HTML code. Images were uploaded for those months in the same position in Javascript. A 'click' function was then utilized to display images base don the buttons interacted with. 

The planner can be accessed by following this [link](https://ceinna.github.io/assignment-2/).
